The String type is most often used by GraphQL to represent free-form human-readable text.\"\nscalar String\n\n\"The `ID` scalar type represents a unique identifier, often used to refetch an object or as key for a cache. The ID type appears in a JSON response as a String; however, it is not intended to be human-readable. When expected as an input type, any string (such as `\\\"4\\\"`) or integer (such as `4`) input value will be accepted as an ID.\"\nscalar ID\n\n\"The `Boolean` scalar type represents `true` or `false`.\"\nscalar Boolean\n\n\"The `Int` scalar type represents non-fractional signed whole numeric values.

It exposes all available types and directives on the server, as well as the entry points for query, mutation, and subscription operations.\"\ntype __Schema {\n  \"A list of all types supported by this server.\"\n  types: [__Type!]!\n  \"The type that query operations will be rooted at.\"\n  queryType: __Type!\n  \"If this server supports mutation, the type that mutation operations will be rooted at.\"\n  mutationType: __Type\n  \"If this server support subscription, the type that subscription operations will be rooted at.\"\n  subscriptionType: __Type\n  \"A list of all directives supported by this server.\"\n  directives: [__Directive!]!\n}\n\n\"The fundamental unit of any GraphQL Schema is the type. There are many kinds of types in GraphQL as represented by the `__TypeKind` enum.\\n\\nDepending on the kind of a type, certain fields describe information about that type. Scalar types provide no information beyond a name and description, while Enum types provide their values. Object and Interface types provide the fields they describe. Abstract types, Union and Interface, provide the Object types possible at runtime. List and NonNull types compose other types.\"\ntype __Type {\n  kind: __TypeKind!\n  name: String\n  description: String\n  fields(includeDeprecated: Boolean = false): [__Field!]\n  interfaces: [__Type!]\n  possibleTypes: [__Type!]\n  enumValues(includeDeprecated: Boolean = false): [__EnumValue!]\n  inputFields: [__InputValue!]\n  ofType: __Type\n}\n\n\"An enum describing what kind of type a given `__Type` is.\"\nenum __TypeKind {\n  \"Indicates this type is a scalar.\"\n  SCALAR\n  \"Indicates this type is an object. `fields` and `interfaces` are valid fields.\"\n  OBJECT\n  \"Indicates this type is an interface. `fields` and `possibleTypes` are valid fields.\"\n  INTERFACE\n  \"Indicates this type is a union. `possibleTypes` is a valid field.\"\n  UNION\n  \"Indicates this type is an enum. `enumValues` is a valid field.\"\n  ENUM\n  \"Indicates this type is an input object. `inputFields` is a valid field.\"\n  INPUT_OBJECT\n  \"Indicates this type is a list. `ofType` is a valid field.\"\n  LIST\n  \"Indicates this type is a non-null. `ofType` is a valid field.\"\n  NON_NULL\n}\n\ntype Query {\n  hero(episode: Episode!): Character\n  character(characterIds: [ID!]!): [Character!]!\n  human(id: ID!): Human\n  droid(id: ID!): Droid\n  search(text: String): [SearchResult]\n}\n\ntype Mutation {\n  createReview(episode: Episode! review: ReviewInput!): Review!\n}\n\ntype Subscription {\n  onReview(episode: Episode!): Review!\n}\n\ntype Human implements Character {\n  id: ID!\n  appearsIn: [Episode]\n  friends: [Character]\n  height(unit: Unit): Float\n  name: String\n  homePlanet: String\n}\n\ntype Droid implements Character {\n  id: ID!\n  appearsIn: [Episode]\n  friends: [Character]\n  height(unit: Unit): Float\n  name: String\n  primaryFunction: String\n}\n\nenum Episode {\n  NEWHOPE\n  EMPIRE\n  JEDI\n}\n\ninterface Character {\n  id: ID!\n  name: String\n  friends: [Character]\n  appearsIn: [Episode]\n  height(unit: Unit): Float\n}\n\nunion SearchResult = Starship | Human | Droid\n\ntype Review {\n  stars: Int!\n  commentary: String\n}\n\ninput ReviewInput {\n  stars: Int!\n  commentary: String\n}\n\nenum Unit {\n  FOOT\n  METERS\n}\n\ntype Starship {\n  id: String\n  name: String\n  length: Float!\n}\n\n\"Directs the executor to skip this field or fragment when the `if` argument is true.\"\ndirective @skip(\"Skipped when true.\" if: Boolean!) on FIELD | FIELD_DEFINITION | INLINE_FRAGMENT | FRAGMENT_SPREAD\n\n\"Directs the executor to include this field or fragment only when the `if` argument is true.\"\ndirective @include(\"Included when true.\" if: Boolean!) on FIELD | FIELD_DEFINITION | INLINE_FRAGMENT | FRAGMENT_SPREAD"
